# OAKARA Theme

## Notes

- Since the merchant does not need to create or modify page structures in the theme editor, this theme uses legacy Liquid templates instead of JSON templates. This approach is simpler than creating a dedicated main-*.liquid section for each page (with all markup embedded, no presets defined) and then adding it as the sole section to the corresponding JSON template (https://github.com/Shopify/dawn).
